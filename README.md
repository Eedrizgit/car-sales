# Recommendations

Chevrolet recorded the highest sales between 2022/2023, and the sales figure is highly significant to the sales made by some companies, especially Jaguar. This trend is likely to continue in the coming year as it will be difficult for some of these companies to compete with Chevrolet. Though the margin could be reduced with regular sales promotion.

From the analysis, dealers from the Middletown region have the least sales which might not necessarily mean the dealers are doing great in sales promotion. It could be as a result of other factors since every region has their own peculiarity such as the preferred choice of transportation. However, if that is not the case, the dealers in Middletown could still match up to the dealers in the Austin region or at least close the margin through continuous sales promotion.

The choice of car model could be linked to personal preferences, taste and other factors. The company should reduce the building of Sebring Conv. and other models with low demand and build those that will likely bring in revenue faster like Diamante.

Rabun used cars and Progressive Shippers Cooperative Association No should be recognized by Car companies as “First Class Car Dealer”, this will encourage them and at the same time push other dealers to emulate them. thereby bringing more sales. Incentives should be given to the of them and other dealers who perform excellently.

Since SUV is the most demanded body type and more than 2 times more demanded than Hardtop, they should consider producing more SUV and less Hardtop. the funds assigned for the production of Hardtop should be reduced and probably diverted to the production of SUV.

Companies that had less patronage should consider each region’s needs and start sales promotion and very easy to buy options that will help boost their sales.
